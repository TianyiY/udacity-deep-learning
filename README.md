Image classification using deep learning (CNN)

Classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. 
Preprocessed the images, then trained a convolutional neural network on all the samples. 
The images are normalized and the labels are one-hot encoded. 
Built a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. 
At the end, predicted on the sample images by neural networks .

software and package requirements:
- Python 3.5
- Tensorflow
- numpy, scipy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib
- urllib, tqdm, tarfile, pickle
